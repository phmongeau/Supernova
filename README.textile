_export your Google reader starred items_

You need to change the '@'s in the url (line 8 in supernova.rb) with your user id.

If you have more than 1000 starred items, just change the number at the end of the url to something higher than your number of starred items.

To get your user id:
	- Go in the settings of Google reader
	- Go to the "Folders and Tags" tab
	- Make your starred items public by clicking the feed icon
	- click the view public page link
	- your id is the big number in the url
